## Introduction

`WINDFORME` Project.

The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we interact with technology in our daily lives, and this project is no exception. Introducing the WINDFORME a fully automated fan system solution designed to bring comfort and convenience to your home or office. This system leverages the power of IoT to create a smart, self-regulating environment that adjusts to your changing needs. The fan system is equipped with a range of sensors and controls that work in tandem to monitor the temperature, humidity, and other key parameters in the room. It then uses this information to automatically adjust the speed of the fan, ensuring that you always have a comfortable and optimal indoor climate. Whether you're at home, at work, or away, this system takes care of your comfort, providing you with peace of mind and a more enjoyable indoor environment.

It has a large number of peripherals including GPIOs, timers, ADC, SPI, I2C, and UART interfaces, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, including IoT devices, embedded systems, and other control systems.

The Nucleo F401RE board is also equipped with various onboard components interfaces and connectors, including an ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer, Arduino Uno V3, USB connector and a set of expansion connectors for connecting to other boards or sensors. It also supports the mbed development platform, which provides a wealth of libraries, examples, and online resources to help developers get started quickly and easily.

Overall, the Nucleo F401RE is a compact and cost-effective development board that is well-suited for building IoT applications. It provides a powerful and flexible platform for developers to explore the possibilities of the IoT.

### Humidity Sensor : `DHT11`

The DHT-11 is a low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensing element and a thermistor to measure the ambient air temperature and humidity. The sensor uses a single-wire digital interface to communicate with the microcontroller, making it easy to integrate into a variety of projects.

The DHT-11 sensor is commonly used in projects related to home automation, weather stations, and other applications where temperature and humidity readings are needed. It is known for its accuracy, reliability, and low cost, making it a popular choice among hobbyists and makers.

The DHT-11 sensor typically has a range of measurement of 20% to 90% relative humidity and 0°C to 50°C temperature, and can provide readings with a resolution of 1% for humidity and 1°C for temperature.

In terms of electrical specifications, the DHT-11 sensor operates at a supply voltage of 3.3V to 5V and has a maximum current consumption of 2.5 mA. It also has a response time of 2s, meaning that it takes about 2 seconds for the sensor to provide a new reading after it has been triggered.

### 7-Segment display : `v. 3461BS-1`

A 7-segment display, such as the 3461BS-1, is a type of electronic display device used for displaying decimal numerals. It consists of seven individual segments that can be illuminated to form the numerals 0-9. The 7-segment display is commonly used in digital clocks, calculators, and other devices that display numerical information. Each segment is made up of a light-emitting diode (LED) or liquid crystal, and they are arranged in a rectangular pattern to form the numbers. By illuminating different combinations of segments, different numerals can be displayed.

### Motor : `Mabuchi FC-130RA/SA`
The FC-130RA is commonly used in a variety of applications, including small robots, remote-controlled cars, drones due to its small size, high power output, and efficiency.

The FC-130RA is a compact motor, measuring only 26mm in diameter and 20mm in length, making it well-suited for use in tight spaces. Despite its small size, it is capable of producing up to 130 g-cm of torque and can operate at high speeds, reaching up to 15,000 RPM.

This motor is designed to operate on a voltage range of 3V to 12V DC, allowing for flexible power supply options. It has a 3mm diameter shaft with a D-shaped cross section, making it easy to mount and attach other components. The motor features a set of solderable tabs for power and ground connections, making it simple to integrate into a circuit.
